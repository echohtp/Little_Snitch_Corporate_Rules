# Little Snitch Rule Groups

This repo provides rule groups for Little Snitch based on the community efforts located [here](https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists).

In each folder you'll find `.lsrules` files which can be directly subscribed to in Little Snitch.

There are rule groups for both `ALLOW` and `DENY`, use as needed.
